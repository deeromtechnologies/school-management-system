  <h1> About / Welcome</h1>
  <center><img src="images/c.jpg" alt="image" height="400 px" width="1000 px"></center>
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>The First Academy is a CBSC/ISE Residential School, whose mission is to prepare children for life as leaders who choose character before career, wisdom beyond scholarship, service before self, and participation as a way of life.</p>
  <p>All parents want their child to attend a great school – not just a good school.
  <p>Great teachers understand that true education involves more than just teaching the mind – it begins with reaching the heart. Great teachers understand that students aren’t interested in finding out how much a teacher knows until they find out how much a teacher cares.</p>
  <p>Teachers at The First Academy are called Living Curriculum Influencers. They are Prayer Warriors, Servant Leaders,Relationship Builders, Faithful Encouragers, Grateful Communicators, and Engaging Instructors. Though they come in all different shapes and sizes, have varied backgrounds and experiences, and possess unique personality types, I believe these characteristics set them apart from all other teachers in India. We are blessed to have these remarkable men and women leading our students.</p>
  <p>The First Academy is a great school. I invite you to experience it for yourself and your family. Please call our Office of Admissions today to schedule a campus visit. Walk the halls, sit in on a class, listen to the conversations of our students and faculty, and I believe you will recognize what makes The First Academy distinctive and a great school for your children and your family.</p><br>

  <p>VICTORIA  ELIZABETH </p>
  <P>Head Of School.</P>
